# Random Forest for Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project was developed for the Machine Learning course at UEH, focusing on applying the Random Forest algorithm to predict hotel booking cancellations. The report includes theoretical exploration, algorithm enhancements, and practical experimentation on a real-world dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand and implement the Random Forest algorithm.
- Handle missing data, outliers, and feature selection for optimal model performance.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and Out-of-Bag (OOB) error estimation.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Dataset: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Decision Trees**: The foundation of Random Forest; limitations like overfitting and sensitivity to outliers were analyzed.
- **Random Forest**: Built multiple trees using bootstrapped data and random feature selection to reduce variance and improve generalization.
- **Out-of-Bag Samples**: Used OOB samples to estimate generalization error without splitting the dataset.
- **Feature Importance**: Measured via split-criterion improvement and accuracy degradation after permutation.
